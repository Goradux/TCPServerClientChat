# TCPServerClientChat

This is a pretty basic TCP server/client chat program with a slight modification allowing to send multiple messages in a row without waiting for a response from the other side.

To exit the program use "quit" command.

1. To run the server:
  ~~~
  $ javac TCPServer.java
  $ java TCPServer
  ~~~

2. To run the client:
 ~~~
 $ javac TCPClient.java
 $ java TCPClient
 ~~~

Feel free to use the code!
